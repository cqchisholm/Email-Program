# Email Program

In this project, designed by Harvard's CS50w course, I have created an email platform. You can log in, send and receive emails, archive and reply to emails. This web app uses Javascript to move between these pages quickly.

### Login screen

### Inbox
Here you will see all emails in your inbox. Emails in white are unread. Once the email is clicked on it will turn grey.

### Compose
You can compose an email to anyone who already has a registered email address.

### Archived
You will fine all emails you have marked to archive here. You can unarchive any email by clicking on the "Unarachive" button when viewing the email.

### Viewing an email
When viewing an email you can reply or archive.

### Reply
When replying to an email it will automatically fill in the "From" and "To" fields, as well as add a "re: " to the subject line unless one is already present.

The body of the email will automatically add the message you are responding to with a timestamp and who sent it. The message will be displayed a couple lines down the page and will automatically start your cursor at the beginning of the text box.
